# Spotify Top 50 Tracks â€“ Data Cleaning & Analysis with Pandas

This project demonstrates basic data transformation and manipulation techniques using Python's `pandas` library.  
The goal is to answer several data-focused questions related to Spotify's top 50 songs by applying practical data analysis skills.

# Objective

The main objective of this project is to:
- Explore and understand the structure of the Spotify dataset
- Clean and transform columns for better readability
- Answer a set of questions directly within the Jupyter Notebook using code comments and pandas operations

The analysis is structured in a way that each code block answers a specific data-related question, as commented throughout the notebook.

#  Dataset

The dataset contains 50 records (songs) and 17 features, including:
- `artist`, `album`, `track_name`, `genre`
- Audio features: `energy`, `danceability`, `acousticness`, `valence`, `tempo`, etc.
- Technical attributes: `key`, `loudness`, `speechiness`, `instrumentalness`, `duration_ms`

# Requirements
To use this notebook, you need to download the csv file and put the file path in your pc, according to where the csv is contained. 

# To check the work 
The analysis is included in a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb), available in this repository. The notebook includes:
- Data cleaning
- Data manipulation
- Pandas library
